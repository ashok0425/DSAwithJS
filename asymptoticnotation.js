// In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we donâ€™t measure the actual running time). We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size. 


// Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.


// The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 


// Notation types 
// Big O notation- worst case 
// Big Omega  notation- Best case 
// Big Thita notation- Avarege case 


// Big O notation 
//    It  is used to describe the aysmptotic of upper bound.

// / Big Omgea notation 
//    It  is used to describe the aysmptotic of lower bound.


// / Big Thita notation 
//    It  is used to describe running time of algorithm
